This project consists of a library containing all the data structures learned throughout the data structures course.

The project is a capture the flag game where there are two players, each of whom can have a maximum of 3 bots. Each bot moves according to one of the presented algorithms.
The flags and bots of each player play on a linked map structure, and each bot's objective is to move to the opponent's flag and return to base. 
There may be cases where a bot is caught and loses the flag it is carrying, in which case the bot must retrieve the flag again.

Programmed 100% in Java.
